# hello-world

Hi, person!

I am a total beginner and am currently (as of July 13, 2017) starting my adventure on FreeCodeCamp to achieve my first ever Front End Developer certificatation. I have dabbled a bit on Khan Academy, and thus far have finished their Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation, Intro to HTML/CSS: Building Webpages, and Intro to SQL: Querying and Managing Data courses. 

I am currently learning just for fun and to have a new hobby. I have a general passion for learning, and programming seems like an interesting and ever-evolving challenge to sink my teeth into. Eventually, I would like to play with Arduino and building cool little robots, but for now, I want to start with general programming skills and give myself new intellectual and creative outlets with which to challenge myself.

I am super excited for the opportunity to learn and so grateful for all the free resources available to self-learners. The vast amount of learning material and classes I've already uncovered has humbled and amazed me. I'm looking forward to where this journey will take me!
